							<h1>About Me</h1>
								<p>
								My name is Karthik. Currently I spend most of my days as a student at the University of Illinois at 
								Urbana Champaign, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. If you're interested in my resume and other official sorts of things, you'll find those in the next section. Outside of school, I like to
								read, exercise, meditate, learn languages, and take on all sorts of interesting projects.

				<h1>My Interests</h1>
				<ul>
				<li><h3>Meditation</h3>
					<p>Most people use meditation to solve their stress problems or otherwise help them relax, but my interest in it stems from a desire to explore the frontiers of my own mind. At risk of sounding too New Age-y, sinc I started practicing meditation I've noticed a profound increase in self awareness and attentiveness to my own thought patterns. Meditation has also assisted me in shaping these thought patterns and optimizing them for daily life.
					<br/>
					</p>

				</li>
				<li><h3>Language Learning</h3>
					<p>I've always been interested in languages and human communication. Currently, I'm a native speaker of English and I have a high degree of proficiency in French. I also have somewhat of an understanding of Hindi and Tamil. Over the course of my life, however, I've also been conversational in Russian (my abilities now are greatly diminished) and dabbled in German (which I still plan to learn in the future). Why? For no other reason than I love the process and the methods of learning foreign languages- to me, speaking other languages feels much like solving puzzles.<br/></p>
				</li>
				<li><h3>Exercising</h3>
					<p>I've always enjoyed exercise, be it weight lifting, running, or hiking outside (admittedly, Urbana-Champaign doesn't provide for much of the latter). Right now I don't have any specific goal in mind, but I notice marked effects in my mood and energy levels in the days after a hard workout.<br/></p>
				</li>
				<li><h3>Reading</h3>
					<p>Though I don't compare to any serious literary enthusiast, I do enjoy reading. In no particular order, some of my favorite books include <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Picture-Dorian-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486278077/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1423708211&sr=1-1&keywords=the+picture+of+dorian+gray">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a> by Oscar Wilde, <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Prince-Antoine-Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry/dp/0547978847">The Little Prince</a> by Antoine de Saint-Exupery (and I maintain that this is NOT a children's book), and biographies, although those depend much more on the subject and the author's capability.

							<h1>Wisdom</h1>
							<ul>
								<li>"I find that a duck's image of me is very much influenced by whether or not I have bread."- Mitch Hedberg</li>
								<li>“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” -Marcus Aurelius</li>
								<li>"Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent."-Calvin Coolidge</li>
